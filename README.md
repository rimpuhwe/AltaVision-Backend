This is  the initial backend codebase for this Web platform, including complete API structure, authentication, and data models using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

What I'll be  working on:

Initialized Express server and configured MongoDB connection
Set up environment variables support (dotenv)
Built modular file structure:
controllers/ for logic (auth, services, payments, dashboard)
models/ for MongoDB schemas (User, Service, Payment, Booking)
routes/ to organize API endpoints
middleware/ for error handling and auth protection
utils/ for helpers like JWT and email sending
config/db.js for DB connection
